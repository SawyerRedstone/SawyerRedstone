Hey there, I'm Sawyer! :octocat:

âœ¨ I'm an enthusiastic coder and love opportunities to get creative with my work! I am most experienced with Python, but I've worked in C++, Prolog, p5.js, and many other languages.

âš¡ My current obsession is machine learning! I've just started submitting contest entries to Kaggle, and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.
